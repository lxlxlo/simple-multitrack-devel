INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Summary: 

	./build

The build script will try to identify what kind of machine you have
and compile the right code for that.  Please report any compiling
problems.

The programs end up in the ./bin directory.
Before running the programs, you might want to do this:
	
	cd ./bin;
	source shellsetup;

It puts the simple-multitrack programs your path.
And it sets a tiny shell prompt string.
